# RAILS CHALLENGE

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of
your solution?

  This challenge being a back-end, I decided to render data as JSON for all the actions.

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  
  I would have liked to implement service objects to perform all the actions. But as the back-end part of this application was very simple, I did not have to.

- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  
  I would have implement service objects.
  
- How long did it truly take you to complete the challenge?
  
  I complete the rails part of the challenge in about 4 hours. Spend most of the time setting up the test specs.


# REACT CHALLENGE

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of
your solution?

  I noticed you, at DoubleGDP, work with Material UI so I decided to use it to complete the challenge.
  I also used the React Router module as it makes it easy to navigate between the components.

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  
  I could have add tests to cover this front-end part and then better use the style API of Material UI library.
  
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  
  I would have done this challenge from scratch with pure HTML/CSS.
